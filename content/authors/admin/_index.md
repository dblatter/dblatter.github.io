Daniel Blatter is a geophysicist who uses electromagnetic methods and computational mathematics to investigate the solid earth. In particular, Daniel is interested in elucidating the distribution and role of fluids in solid earth systems, from mid-ocean ridges, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and subduction zones, to geothermal energy production, carbon sequestration monitoring, and freshwater exploration and characterization. 

Daniel Blatter is currently the John W Miles postdoctoral scholar in computational and theoretical geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. His current work involves quantifying the distribution of melt and volatiles (water and CO2) at mid-ocean ridges, beneath oceanic lithosphere, and above subducting slabs. His is also researching efficient Bayesian sampling algorithms capable of quantifying uncertainty in inverted models of subsurface physical properties (e.g. electrical resistivity) in a 'short' time (e.g. run times of a few days or less).

Daniel believes strongly that the Academy must educate and conduct cutting edge research in a more just, equitable, inclusive, and sustainable manner. To that end, Daniel is a steward and organizer for UAW 5810, the union of postdocs and research scientists across the University of California system. The goal of Daniel's union organizing efforts is to ensure that the voices of the scientists at the bottom of the academic hierarchy are heard. They are currently organizing postdocs to demand affordable housing and protections against bullying and harassment, among other goals. Daniel was previously a lead organizer and bargaining committee member for the Graduate Workers of Columbia, the union of RAs and TAs at Columbia University.
