summary: Bayesian sampling is now efficient enough to be applied to large geophysical inverse problems.
abstract: "The cause of the low-viscosity layer at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB)
remains debated. The presence of partial melt or water dissolved in mantle minerals are two
possible answers, but they are not mutually exclusive—dissolved volatiles such as water and
CO2 lower the peridotite solidus and also partition preferentially into the melt phase, greatly
lowering its electrical resistivity. Magnetotelluric (MT) data are sensitive to resistivity and thus
to both melt fraction and melt volatile concentration and therefore are ideal for exploring the
origins of the LAB. Placing meaningful constraints on these quantities at depth, however,
requires quantitative uncertainty (UQ) on inverted resistivity models. In the first part of this talk,
I will demonstrate a method for constraining melt fraction and melt volatile concentration at the
LAB through a Monte Carlo scheme that combines UQ on inverted electrical resistivity with
petrological modeling of partial melting on a 1D compatible MT data set collected on the Cocos
plate. Extending this to 2D and 3D data sets is challenging, as standard Bayesian sampling
methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are too slow to be of practical use for
larger MT inversion problems, while the nature of regularized inversion makes UQ for these
models challenging. In the second part of this talk, I will briefly describe a Bayesian sampling
method called ‘randomize-then-optimize’ (RTO) that can efficiently produce UQ for regularized
inversion problems. I will demonstrate RTO on a 2D marine MT data set collected in the Gulf of
Mexico and propose future work applying the combined Bayesian sampling/petrological
modeling approach to mid-ocean ridge data sets."
