Due to their high computational cost, however, Bayesian inverse methods have largely been restricted to computationally expedient 1-D resistivity models. In this study, we successfully demonstrate, for the first time, a fully 2-D, trans-dimensional Bayesian inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) data. We render this problem tractable from a computational standpoint by using a stochastic interpolation algorithm known as a Gaussian process (GP) to achieve a parsimonious parametrization of the model vis-a-vis the dense parameter grids used in numerical forward modelling codes. The GP links a trans-dimensional, parallel tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, which explores the parsimonious model space, to MARE2DEM, an adaptive finite element forward solver. MARE2DEM computes the model response using a dense parameter mesh with resistivity assigned via the GP model. We demonstrate the new trans-dimensional GP sampler by inverting both synthetic and field MT data for 2-D models of electrical resistivity, with the field data example converging within 10 d on 148 cores, a non-negligible but tractable computational cost. For a field data inversion, our algorithm achieves a parameter reduction of over 32√ó compared to the fixed parameter grid used for the MARE2DEM regularized inversion. Resistivity probability distributions computed from the ensemble of models produced by the inversion yield credible intervals and interquartile plots that quantitatively show the non-linear 2-D uncertainty in model structure. This uncertainty could then be propagated to other physical properties that impact resistivity including bulk composition, porosity and pore-fluid content.","tags":[],"title":"Two-dimensional Bayesian inversion of magnetotelluric data using trans-dimensional Gaussian processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Blatter","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, evaluating quantitatively the model uncertainty reduction is made difficult by the fact that conventional inversion methods‚Äîusing gradients and model regularization‚Äîtypically produce just one model, with no associated estimate of model parameter uncertainty. Bayesian inverse methods can provide quantitative estimates of inverted model parameter uncertainty by generating an ensemble of models, sampled proportional to data fit. The resulting posterior distribution represents a combination of a priori assumptions about the model parameters and information contained in field data. Bayesian inversion is therefore able to quantify the impact of jointly inverting multiple data sets by using the statistical information contained in the posterior distribution. We illustrate, for synthetic data generated from a simple 1-D model, the shape of parameter space compatible with controlled source electromagnetic and magnetotelluric data, separately and jointly. We also demonstrate that when data sets contain complementary information about the model, the region of parameter space compatible with the joint data set is less than or equal to the intersection of the regions compatible with the individual data sets. We adapt a trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for jointly inverting multiple electromagnetic data sets for 1-D earth models and apply it to surface-towed controlled source electromagnetic and magnetotelluric data collected offshore New Jersey, USA, to evaluate the extent of a low salinity aquifer within the continental shelf. Our inversion results identify a region of high resistivity of varying depth and thickness in the upper 500 m of the continental shelf, corroborating results from a previous study that used regularized, gradient-based inversion methods. We evaluate the joint model parameter uncertainty in comparison to the uncertainty obtained from the individual data sets and demonstrate quantitatively that joint inversion offers reduced uncertainty. In addition, we show how the Bayesian model ensemble can subsequently be used to derive uncertainty estimates of pore water salinity within the low salinity aquifer.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian joint inversion of controlled source electromagnetic and magnetotelluric data to image freshwater aquifer offshore New Jersey","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

By contrast, Bayesian sampling techniques produce a large suite of models, all of which fit the data adequately, providing a wealth of statistical information about the model parameters. Importantly, this includes quantitative uncertainty estimates as well as any statistical property of interest. In this work, we apply a Bayesian trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme to recover subsurface conductivity from airborne transient electromagnetic (TEM) data collected over Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, to image subglacial hydrologic structure. We provide a synthetic model study, followed by inversions of real soundings. Our results identify a zone of conductive, wet sediments beneath the glacier, corroborating interpretations from previous studies that used regularized, smooth inversions. Our results provide, however, the opportunity to examine a rich suite of additional information, including uncertainty estimates on the conductivity within the conductive subglacial layer as well as quantitative estimates of its total conductance. We apply principles of Bayesian information theory for estimating the depth of investigation of the airborne TEM data and apply it to this data set. Additionally, we use the model ensemble to derive estimates of pore fluid resistivity within the conductive layer, with associated uncertainties. Finally, we use Bayesian model studies to explore the range of ice thicknesses and conductive layer thicknesses that could be resolved with ground or airborne TEM data if they had one to two orders of magnitude lower noise levels.","tags":[],"title":"Trans-dimensional Bayesian inversion of airborne transient EM data from Taylor Glacier, Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
